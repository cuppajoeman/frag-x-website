    <p>
      The best way to describe frag-x is by what it is trying to represent.
    </p>
    <p>
      frag-x is a game where you are rewarded for having fine tuned movement, mastery of the main aiming styles
      (flicking, tracking, precision) and the ability to predict your opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from the weapons and your movement, there are no skills which can be activated or ways to
      improve your characters attributes. The graphics are minimalistic, and the game should be able to run on computers
      that don't have very good specifications, so that it doesn't restrict who can play the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      The base game modes will be deathmatch, team deathmatch, duel, capture the flag, clan arena and instakill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game is open-source and anyone can see how it works, and is open for anyone
      to contribute as long as they are working towards the specification.
