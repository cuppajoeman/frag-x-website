    <h2>questions about the existing code base</h2> (solutions will come up later in the week)
    <ul>
        <li>When you press w on the keyboard, what are the series of events that occur until your player moves on your screen?</li>
        <li>You shoot and kill a player, what were the series of events until the player is killed and stops moving, how do they show up as red on the screen?</li>
        <li>You run <code>/map_vote dm_blocks</code> in the chat box, how does the map get swapped out? How does the map change on the client side</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Follow up: Why doesn't the server send the map data along with all the players?</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Why does the function <code>recv_all</code> exist?</li>
        <li>What do different colors in the map mean?</li>
    </ul>
